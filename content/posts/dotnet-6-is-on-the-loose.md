James David and Matt go over .NET 6 and .NET Conf and all the goodness! As you know, .NET is a free, open-source software framework for building applications. It was developed by Microsoft and is used for building a variety of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile. .NET is highly compatible with Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, making it easy to deploy and manage applications. The framework is highly modular and extensible, allowing developers to add custom components and libraries to their applications. The framework is highly secure and supports industry standards for security and privacy.
